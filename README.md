📈 Stock Portfolio Tracker (Python)

🎯 Goal

Build a simple "Stock Portfolio Tracker" in Python that calculates total investment value based on user input and predefined stock prices.



 📝 Project Description

- The user enters "stock symbols" and their respective *quantities*.
- A "hardcoded dictionary" holds stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}).
- The script calculates and displays the "total investment value".
- Optionally, the result can be saved to a .txt or .csv file.



 ⚙️ Key Concepts Used

- dictionary for mapping stock prices  
- input() / print() for user interaction  
- basic arithmetic for calculations  
- file handling for writing to .txt or .csv

🚀 How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter stock symbols (like AAPL, TSLA) and quantities.
2. For each valid stock, the program calculates price × quantity.
3. The total investment value is shown.
4. User can choose to save the summary to a file (portfolio.txt or portfolio.csv).

🖥️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Copy the code into a file named portfolio_tracker.py.
3. Run the script in terminal or IDE:
   '''bash
     python stock.py
